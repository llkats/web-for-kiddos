How the Web Works

the web is written in files, ordinary files with special languages


HTML

the first language we use to write websites is HTML

html tells the browser what information you want to write


angle brackets look like this: `<code>&lt; &gt;</code>`

a tag looks like this `<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>`


when we put the `<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>` tag around text and then look at it in a browser, we can see that the browser does something special to the text (does anyone know what this is?), it makes a link. links are what make the internet special: they allow you to travel to other pages around the internet.

to make a link go somewhere, we have to put an attribute inside the tag. let's make this link go to craigslist: `href="www.craigslist.org"`

that's why HTML is named what it is: it stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. "Hyper Text" is a silly name for "links".

we can write a lot of text in the page; we'll surround that with a `<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>` tag, "p" is short for "paragraph".



text, links, images, movies
computers don't know what text is when you just write it
if I make a file and just write in a random thing, the browser doesn't know to do anything special with it
but if I write HTML around it, the browser can start to understand what certain information means

HTML has special words called tags. you know they're special because they go inside symbols called angle brackets
